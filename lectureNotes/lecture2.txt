Uncertainty in AI
    Environments are inherently unpredictable
    Sensors are limited in what they can perceives
    Actuators use motors/mechanisms that are unpredictable
    AI software can cause Uncertainty

Logic Approach: Summarizing Uncertainty
    Dentist Example: Assume the most logical problem aka toothache and then other problems
    This nearly always fails due to laziness, etc..

Probability in AI
    More than single "best guess" as to state of world
    Keep probability distribution over whole space of guesses = belief
    Example problems in robotics:
        Localization: where is a robot?
        Mapping - what does the environment look like?
        Planning - what to do next?
        Control - what control signals need to be sent to accomplish the plan?

    Rational Agent review
        A rational agent chooses whichever action maximizes the expected value
            of the performance peasure, given the percept sequence to date
