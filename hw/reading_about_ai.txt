Read an article or watch a video about any 
latest breakthrough/research in Artificial Intelligence.

Write a paragraph about it (what was cool, what problem they are 
trying to solve, how feasible it is, and how much time will it 
take to make it a reality) and attach the link or the article/video.

In this article researchers at GSU (Georgia State University) were trying to
solve/improve machine vision in terms of color recognition, an area which can be
difficult due to the nature of downscaled color sensing devices on smaller
devices like micro-sized robots. Ultimately this team wants to develop a micro-scale
camera that can enter narrow spaces unreachable by current technology. The research
team states that improvement will increase as improvements in 'van der Waals'
semiconductors improve.
